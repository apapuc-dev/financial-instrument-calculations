# Financial Instrument Calculations

## Task Description

In the financial world we're operating on a term "financial instrument". You can think of it as of a collection of prices of currencies, commodities, derivatives, etc.

For the purpose of this exercise we provide you an input file with multiple time series containing prices of instruments:

-	INSTRUMENT1
-	INSTRUMENT2
-	INSTRUMENT3

File format is as follows:

<INSTRUMENT_NAME>,<DATE>,<VALUE>

For instance:

INSTRUMENT1,12-Mar-2015,12.21

TASK:

Read time series from the file provided and pass all of them to the "calculation module".

Calculation engine needs to calculate:

For INSTRUMENT1 – mean
For INSTRUMENT2 – mean for November 2014
For INSTRUMENT3 – any other statistical calculation that we can compute "on-the-fly" as we read the file (it's up to you)
For any other instrument from the input file - sum of the newest 10 elements (in terms of the date).

Now, we want to emulate the fact that in the real life there are often multiple factors influencing calculations performed on the instrument prices. 
So as part of your task we would like you to set up a database with only one table, called INSTRUMENT_PRICE_MODIFIER with the following columns:

ID (primary key)
NAME (instrument name as read from the input file)
MULTIPLIER - double value that specifies the factor by which the original instrument price should be multiplied.

So in order to determine the final value of a given instrument price for a given date you should do the following:

1. read the line from the input file;
2. query the database to see if there is an entry for the <INSTRUMENT_NAME> you read in the 1st step;
3. if there is - multiply the original <VALUE> by the factor you found in the step 2;
4. if there is no entry - simply use the original <VALUE> from the file.

Please assume that the values in the INSTRUMENT_PRICE_MODIFIER table can change frequently independently of the process you're implementing, 
but not more often than once every 5 seconds.



What needs to be done:

-	Create the maven project.
-	Model the problem using OO principles.
-	Test the solution.
-	Send the source code back via email to us in a zip archive (don't include any executables or jars !)

Remember:

-	Input data is most likely not sorted.
-	We can assume that current date is 19-Dec-2014 – so we’re not expecting any data after that date.
-	Bear in mind that your solution should also work for a file that has many gigabytes of data (with 10k instruments instead of 3); your solution should be capable of handling that much of data !
-   Assume it's vitally important to calculate the abovementioned metrics as quickly as possible; your solution should scale effectively 
-	Validate the date - it should be a business date, i.e. Monday – Friday. Discard entries with non-business date.
- 	Provide a quick description of your solution: how to run and test it, plus some info about important design decisions, profiling you performed etc. 

## Solution
- The application begins with the `FinancialInstrumentCalculationsApplication`, which reads the filename from the command-line argument.
- The `InstrumentFileReaderService` reads data from the file, line by line.
- The `InstrumentParserService` converts each line from a string to an `InstrumentPricePoint` record.
- The `InstrumentPricePoint` are then filtered by the `InstrumentFilter` and passed to the `CalculationsService`.
- `CalculationsService` has a list of `InstrumentCalculators`, where each calculator is responsible for handling the calculations of a specific instrument, with a default fallback to DefaultInstrumentCalculator, which handles all other instruments.
- Finally, the `getFinalResult` method is called. The `CalculationService` retrieves multipliers from an in-memory H2 database using the `InstrumentPriceModifierService`.
- The output is then printed in the logs.
